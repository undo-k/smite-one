# Smite One  
**A WIP lightweight site that provides recommended builds for each God in the popular multiplayer-online-battle-arena [SMITE](https://smitegame.com/.)**  
  
The goal of Smite One is to provide a fast, mobile-friendly build recommendation experience. The frontend is a Vue SPA styled with tailwindcss, and queries data from a Django Rest Framework API backed by a PostgreSQL database. Smite One was designed from a mobile-first point of view for the single-monitor-alt-tab-phobic gamer, but the desktop site is pretty slick too. Ideally by the end of ~~2023~~ 2024 we'll put DotA 2 and League out of business.
  
The live demo can be found [here](https://smite-one-production.up.railway.app/)

Again this is a WIP and the recommended builds you see on the site right now come without warranty and make no guarantees about the statistical significance or validity of item combinations at this time. (I need more data, plz give access to dev API HiRez)
